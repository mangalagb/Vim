Readme for Conformance checking folder


The module mappings we did manually to map files to modules. This information we inputed into the Java program (included in the src folder). vim_decomp_FileDependencies.csv was outputed by Understand for C and it is the file that was read and analyzed by our Java program. We have also included some images generated by Understand for C showing which files call which other files.
